## Overview üåü
The "Friend or Foe" project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to accurately identify military personnel in images, classifying them as either friendly or hostile entities. Utilizing a multi-modal approach, this AI-driven system aims to significantly enhance decision-making accuracy in high-pressure military engagements by minimizing the risks associated with misidentification.

## Context üîç
In the complex and fast-paced environment of modern warfare, correctly distinguishing between ally and enemy combatants is crucial but challenging due to diverse uniforms and equipment. Our project addresses this challenge by applying cutting-edge image recognition technology to accurately detect and classify military targets based on their visual signatures.

## Project Scope üìê
- **Inclusion**: Focus on identifying personnel from two distinct military forces, labeled as 'friendly' and 'foe' for the purposes of this project.
- **Exclusion**: The system is not designed to recognize civilians in military-like attire, differentiate non-combatants from combatants, or identify personnel wearing obsolete or non-standard military uniforms.

## Challenges üöß
- Assembling a comprehensive dataset was achieved by pooling publicly available images, categorized into specific military branches and subsequently narrowed down into two primary classes for simplicity.
- Overcoming the camouflaging effect and image occlusions involved sophisticated data augmentation techniques and the adoption of a robust machine learning model capable of high-accuracy classification despite these challenges.


## Technical Highlights üí°
- Dataset Preparation: Utilized Roboflow for dataset augmentation and preprocessing, enhancing the initial set of 1100 images to 2652 through techniques like random rotation, Gaussian blur, and noise addition, ensuring a diverse training set.
- Model Training: Selected YOLOv8 variants for their balance between speed and accuracy, adapting model training to encompass a range of complexities from simple object detection to intricate segmentation tasks, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of model capabilities.
