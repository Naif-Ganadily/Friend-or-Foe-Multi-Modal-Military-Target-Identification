## Friend or Foe - Multi-Modal Military Target Identification



## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning system capable of identifying military personnel in images as friend or foe with a degree of certainty. This AI system is intended to assist soldiers in high-stress environments by reducing the risk of human error in target identification.

## Context
In modern warfare, distinguishing between friend and foe is critical. With various forces intermingling on the battlefield, each with different uniforms, the cost of misidentification can be fatal. Our system uses image recognition to optically highlight potential targets and classify them with an associated confidence score.

## Project Scope
- **Inclusion**: This model will initially focus on two military entities, identifying one as 'friendly' and the other as 'foe'.
- **Exclusion**: The model will not account for civilians in camouflage, differentiate between terrorists and civilians, or recognize outdated military uniforms.

## Challenges
- Creating a comprehensive dataset from publicly available images.
- The inherent design of camouflage to obscure identification.
- Dealing with images that may contain occlusions like equipment and debris.

## Installation
- TODO
