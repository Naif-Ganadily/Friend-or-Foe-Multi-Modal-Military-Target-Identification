## Overview üåü
The "Friend or Foe" project, developed by a team from the University of Washington for the course EE P 567: Machine Learning for Cybersecurity, introduces a groundbreaking approach to military target identification using a combination of advanced machine learning models. By leveraging the YOLOv8 algorithm and the Segment Anything Model (SAM), our project offers a robust solution for differentiating between friendly and enemy forces in real-time, aiming to mitigate the risks of friendly fire and enhance operational decision-making on the battlefield.

## Context üîç
Modern battlefields present an intricate challenge in target identification due to the utilization of camouflage, guerrilla tactics, and the physical and psychological strains on soldiers. Our solution addresses these challenges by integrating cutting-edge image recognition and segmentation technologies, providing soldiers with an AI-assisted tool that significantly improves accuracy in identifying and classifying military personnel based on their visual signatures. This technology aims to reduce casualties caused by misidentification and augment the effectiveness of military engagements.

## Project Scope üìê
**Inclusion:** Our model focuses on identifying military personnel from the United States and Russian armed forces, differentiating them as 'friendly' or 'foe' for project purposes. This distinction is crucial for training the AI to recognize different uniforms and equipment visually.
**Exclusion:** The project explicitly does not cover the recognition of civilians in military attire, the distinction between non-combatants and combatants, or identification of individuals in non-standard or obsolete military uniforms.
**Challenges:** Developing a comprehensive and balanced dataset was a significant challenge, overcome by assembling images from publicly available sources, categorized by military branch. Sophisticated data augmentation techniques and a robust machine learning model were essential in addressing issues such as camouflage and occlusions.

## Technical Approach üõ†
Utilizing the YOLOv8 and SAM models, our project applies advanced machine learning techniques for real-time object detection and segmentation. The models were trained on a custom dataset of military personnel, focusing on optimizing performance despite the challenges of camouflage and image occlusions. Our methodology included fine-tuning the models to achieve high accuracy in classification tasks, incorporating data augmentation for robustness, and testing under various conditions to ensure reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.


## Experimental Results and Analysis üìä
Our experimentation demonstrated the potential of our AI-driven system to accurately distinguish between friendly and enemy forces, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 75.7%. These results underline the system's capability to enhance situational awareness and decision-making in military operations. The project also explored the integration of a challenge-response system (CRS) for added security, showcasing the system's adaptability to different operational needs.
